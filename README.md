## CONCLUSION & DISCUSSION
### Pros and Cons of our application:

- Pros: 
The admin process becomes easier as posts can be accepted or rejected without any paperwork.
 Landlords can easily and quickly post articles about the types of real estate they want to rent, with just a few simple steps and no need for paperwork. 
Users don't have to go out and search for rental places; instead, they can sit at home with an electronic device connected to the internet and find thousands of rental options. 
Additionally, the admin offers great coupons and Landlords providing excellent deals on rental services for users .
- Cons: 
The acceptance of posts from landlords depends on the credibility of the information provided in the article. The administrator will decide whether to approve or cancel the post based on whether it contains sufficient information. 
Even if a landlord's post is approved, there is still no guarantee that it accurately represents what the landlord advertised. 
On the user side, since users have not undergone full verification, there may be issues related to theft or fraud.
Up to now, our application is not fully completed, so it still has many issues about security or authorization is not trustworthy.


### We’ve learned during developing of our application:
Creating a complete website is not easy, but we still try our best to get the job done but there are still some shortcomings. After working together, we learned from this process how to work together as a team to be able to create an application, how to communicate and work together without letting conflict happen . The most important thing is that we can learn the basics of a web application (CRUD), from which we can learn and design more advanced things than what we have learned in school.

### We would improve out application in the future:
We realize that our website currently has many shortcomings, if given the opportunity, we will improve it:
- First in terms of GUI: it's still not a great interface so it definitely needs a lot of improvement as the current version is still not 100% what we suggested earlier.
- 2nd in terms of system design: there are still a lot of necessary functions but we didn't have time to do () and more advanced things like verify user and landlord to increase reliability more for the website.
